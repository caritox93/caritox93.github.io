<p>I have been involved in various leadership programs at the University of Florida, I have been involved with several case competitions, including companies like P&G and Target. I have also helped students by recommending various tips on how to get an internship and evaluated their resume for critiques.

<p>I have been in an array of organizations that span from the Public Relations Student Society of America to Delta Sigma Pi, a business fraternity. I am also highly passionate about music and has helped artists in her local community get recognition through her Wordpress blog and volunteer for promotions and show bookings. I am also learning some basic graphic design and Photoshop skills and would love to work and collaborate with others in that field.</p>
